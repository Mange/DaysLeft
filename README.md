### FAQ ###

**How do I install this?**

Check the [Downloads page of Github][downloads] and you can download a compiled version. You can even get a QR code so you can download it directly on the phone.

**Can I change the date or text of a widget?**

Yes, just tap the title and the configuration dialog will open again.

**Will this drain a lot of batteries?**

It shouldn't. It only updates once per hour and if the screen is turned off, the refresh will be postponed until the screen is turned on again.

**What version of Android is required?**

Android 2.3 is the minimum supported version. 3.0 or later is recommended in case you want to resize the widget.

**My title is cut off! How do I fix this?**

Make the widget wider (Android 3.0+, or alternative homescreen) or shorten the words. Building in autoscaling font sizes is overkill for this simple widget.

**What langugages are supported?**

English and Swedish is fully supported. All other languages will use the English version.


**Can you add X? Fix Y?**

Perhaps. Open up a new issue and I'll tell you what I think.
